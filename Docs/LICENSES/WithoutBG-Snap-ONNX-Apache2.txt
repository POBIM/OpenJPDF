Model: withoutbg/snap (ONNX Model)
Purpose: Automatic background removal from images
Model Type: Deep Learning Model (U²-Net based)
Framework: ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)

DESCRIPTION:
The withoutbg/snap model is an AI-powered image segmentation model that
automatically removes backgrounds from images. It uses deep learning to:
- Detect foreground objects
- Create precise segmentation masks
- Remove backgrounds with high accuracy
- Preserve fine details (hair, edges, transparency)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Model Format: ONNX
- Input: RGB images (variable size)
- Output: Binary segmentation mask + image with transparent background
- Architecture: U²-Net (U-squared Network)
- Training Data: Diverse image dataset with manual annotations
- Performance: Real-time processing on CPU/GPU

USAGE IN OpenJPDF:
- Integrated via Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime
- Processed through SixLabors.ImageSharp
- Provides automatic background removal feature
- Optional AI enhancement for image editing

✓ Free to modify and distribute
✓ Free to use in proprietary applications

REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Include license notice
✓ State changes made to the model
✓ Include a copy of the Apache 2.0 license

NOTE ON MODEL FILES:
The ONNX model file (snap.onnx or similar) is included in the OpenJPDF
installation in the models/ directory. The model file itself is subject
to the Apache License 2.0 terms.

PERFORMANCE NOTES:
- First run may be slower due to model initialization
- Subsequent operations use cached model
- GPU acceleration available if ONNX Runtime with CUDA is installed
- CPU fallback available for all platforms
